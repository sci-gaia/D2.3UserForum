# Outcomes of the Online User Forum

# Executive Summary

This document describes the Sci-GaIA web-based User Forum, one of the services of the Sci-GaIA Open Science Platform. This deliverable describes the work done in Task 2.1\. This document will describe the need for such a forum, comparing the situation at the time of the start of the project, with that at the end. We will show how the forum has supported the scientific and technical communities directly through it's community development role, but also indirectly, by demonstrating the benefit to be had from the others services in the Sci-GaIA Open Science Platform, such as the identity federations and online learning services.

We report on certain quantitative measurements collected over the period of the project and show how it has also qualitatively improved the level of collaboration between new and existing research communities. As the project has progressed, so we have ever sought to demonstrate novel and enabling functionality of the forum, and we discuss how the forum has been woven into the platform in support other services. We finally argue that the discussion forum is a crucial, often overlooked part of any e-infrastructure, and propose strategies for sustaining and growing the communities supported by it after the project has fnished.


# The need for a user forum

As a Coordination and Support Action, Sci-GaIA had a clear mission : to energise scientific communities, by providing
 them with tools and services relevant to research in the 21st century. The project was funded with the acknowledgement
 that the partners had both access to _communities_ as well as the tools  which they would exploit for success. However
 competent and experienced the partners may be though, a common factor was needed - an expression of that energy which
  lay latent in the communities. Herein lies the need for a forum.

## The need for a _new_ user forum

Online community engagement is a low-yield activity. The nature of the web means that there is a great probability that
any new service, platform or social network will hardly register in the attention register of the target community. In
order to concentrate effort on community management, several organisers tend to adopt existing social networks, and
then hone them towards their particular needs. The web offers a very rich choice of means for cultivating communities,
both "open" and "closed". Their adoption rates speak for  themselves. Often communities are enticed by "walled gardens"
- platforms which provide closed, configurable environments which can be customised towards any particular end-use.
Examples of these would be creating a facebook group, a slack instance, or a private subreddit. The "Free Code Camp"
for example is a worldwide community of  students of all levels interested in developing non-profit startups, and uses
a series  of Facebook groups for organising their local camps. Slack has seen immense adoption, as has WhatsApp,
however, these do not leave a lasting record.

Arguably the best two platforms on the web for engaging around specific topics or technologies are Reddit and Stack
 Exchange. Reddit has
<!-- TODO : How many technical subreddits are there ? -->
and
<!-- TODO : How many reddit users are there ? -->
Stack Exchange is the technical question and answer site par-excellence on the web, with over
<!-- TODO how many Stack Exchange sites are there ? --> specific sites. The most relevant ones for us had active users
 as follows :
<!-- TODO check the most relevant Stack Exchange sites -->

| Site      | Questions     | Active Users |
| :------------- | :------------- | :-----------------------|
| StackOverflow | | |
| Academia | | |
| ServerFault | | |
| Open Science | | |

It would have been very tempting to simply start a subreddit, or use a tag on StackExchange to provide the Sci-GaIA
User Forum. The algorithms which power these services  have evolved over years and via the interactions of hundreds of
millions of users to be as efficient as possible in guiding desired community interaction and user behaviour, as well
as to surface quality, relevant information whilst diminish the background noise. However, in the final analysis, they
_do not provide the service required_. We needed a service over which we could maintain control and agility, putting it
to work to serve the specific purposes of the communities we identified, in the timeline allowed by the project. We
discuss these parameters in the  following section.

## Design Criteria

The Sci-GaIA User Forum needed to be based o the best practice and platform in existence. Managing a
community and stimulating online interaction is an extremely demanding activitiy, with very low success
rates, often leading to many anti-social behaviours, or at best apathy and abandonment. Although we had set
modest goals for the uptake of the forum, choosing anything but the best tool would have made reaching even
those quite difficult. As a guiding principle, it was agreed that the forum should be built in a way which could both directly support the other activities of the project, as well as indirectly energise communities in unforseen ways.

At the start of Sci-GaIA a meeting was held to critically examine the scenario and decide the course of action. We had set out a few technical criteria for the Forum :

  1. **Allow federated access** -
  1. Permit integration with other Sci-GaIA services via API
  1. Provide a common experience across the platform
  1. Provide quantitative insights into user behaviour - adoption, retention, _etc_.
  1.

Apart from these,   

  1. Encourage engagement, providing a comfortable, welcoming environment.
  1. Discourage anti-social behaviour, rewarding constructive and collaborative behaviour
  1.

The Sci-GaIA proposal, written in 2014, put forth Liferay Message Boards as the tool of choice
